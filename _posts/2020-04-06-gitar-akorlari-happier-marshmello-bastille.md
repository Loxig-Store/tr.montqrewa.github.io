**5. Perdeye Kapo (Kelepçe)**

<u>[Intro]</u><br/>
**Am**     ...........       Geçiş **C/B*** sonra **C**<br/>
**L**ately, I've been, **I've** been **t**hinking<br/>
.................................**F**.............................................**F**<br/>
I want you to be **h**appier, I want you to be **h**appier<br/>

<u>[Verse 1]</u><br/>
.....................**G**.............**Am**<br/>
When the **m**orning **c**omes<br/>
......................................**C/B*** **C**<br/>
When we see what **we've** **b**ecome<br/>
...........................................................**F**<br/>
In the cold light of day we're a **f**lame in the wind<br/>
.................................................**F**<br/>
Not the fire that we've be**g**un<br/>
............**G**.....**Am**..............................**C/B***...**C**<br/>
Every **a**rgu**m**ent, every word we **can't** **t**ake back<br/>

'Cause with the all that has happened<br/>
**F**......................................................................................**F**<br/>
I **t**hink that we both know the way that this story **e**nds<br/>

<u>[Chorus]</u><br/>
**G**.........**Am**................**C/B*** **C**<br/>
**T**hen **o**nly for a min**ute**<br/>
.....................................**F**<br/>
I want to change my **m**ind<br/>
...............................................**F**<br/>
'Cause this just don't feel **r**ight to me<br/>

I wanna raise your spirits<br/>

I want to see you smile but<br/>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>



Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Verse 2]</u><br/>
When the evening falls<br/>

And I'm left there with my thoughts<br/>

And the image of you being with someone else<br/>

Well, that's eating me up inside<br/>

But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay<br/>

Now if we jump together at least we can swim<br/>

Far away from the wreck we made<br/>

<u>[Chorus]</u><br/>
Then only for a minute<br/>

I want to change my mind<br/>

'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>

I wanna raise your spirits<br/>

I want to see you smile but<br/>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>



Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Bridge]</u><br/>
So I'll go, I'll go<br/>

I will go, go, go<br/>

So I'll go, I'll go<br/>

I will go, go, go<br/>

<u>[Pre-Chorus]</u><br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

Even though I might not like this<br/>

I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Chorus]</u><br/>
Then only for a minute (only for a minute)<br/>

I want to change my mind<br/>

'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>

I wanna raise your spirits<br/>

I want to see you smile but<br/>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>



Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Outro]</u><br/>
So I'll go, I'll go<br/>

I will go, go, go<br/>
