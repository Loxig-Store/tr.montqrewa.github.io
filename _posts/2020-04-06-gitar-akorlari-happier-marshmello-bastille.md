**5. Perdeye Kapo (Kelepçe)**

**Am** **Geçiş C/B*** **C**<br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>
**F**                   **F**          **G**<br/>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

When the morning comes<br/>
When we see what we've become<br/>
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind<br/>
Not the fire that we've begun<br/>
Every argument, every word we can't take back<br/>
'Cause with the all that has happened<br/>
I think that we both know the way that this story ends<br/>
Then only for a minute<br/>
I want to change my mind<br/>
'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>
I wanna raise your spirits<br/>
I want to see you smile but<br/>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>
When the evening falls<br/>
And I'm left there with my thoughts<br/>
And the image of you being with someone else<br/>
Well, that's eating me up inside<br/>
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay<br/>
Now if we jump together at least we can swim<br/>
Far away from the wreck we made<br/>
Then only for a minute<br/>
I want to change my mind<br/>
'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>
I wanna raise your spirits<br/>
I want to see you smile but<br/>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>
So I'll go, I'll go<br/>
I will go, go, go<br/>
So I'll go, I'll go<br/>
I will go, go, go<br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>
Even though I might not like this<br/>
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>
Then only for a minute (only for a minute)<br/>
I want to change my mind<br/>
'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>
I wanna raise your spirits<br/>
I want to see you smile but<br/>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>
So I'll go, I'll go<br/>
I will go, go, go<br/>
