**5. Perdeye Kapo (Kelepçe)**

<u>[Intro]</u><br/>
**Am**     .......       Geçiş **C/B*** sonra **C**<br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>
**F**............................................**F**...................................................**G**<br/>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Verse 1]</u><br/>
When the morning comes<br/>

When we see what we've become<br/>

In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind<br/>

Not the fire that we've begun<br/>

Every argument, every word we can't take back<br/>

'Cause with the all that has happened<br/>

I think that we both know the way that this story ends<br/>

<u>[Chorus]</u><br/>
Then only for a minute<br/>

I want to change my mind<br/>

'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>

I wanna raise your spirits<br/>

I want to see you smile but<br/>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>



Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Verse 2]</u><br/>
When the evening falls<br/>

And I'm left there with my thoughts<br/>

And the image of you being with someone else<br/>

Well, that's eating me up inside<br/>

But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay<br/>

Now if we jump together at least we can swim<br/>

Far away from the wreck we made<br/>

<u>[Chorus]</u><br/>
Then only for a minute<br/>

I want to change my mind<br/>

'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>

I wanna raise your spirits<br/>

I want to see you smile but<br/>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>



Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Bridge]</u><br/>
So I'll go, I'll go<br/>

I will go, go, go<br/>

So I'll go, I'll go<br/>

I will go, go, go<br/>

<u>[Pre-Chorus]</u><br/>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

Even though I might not like this<br/>

I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Chorus]</u><br/>
Then only for a minute (only for a minute)<br/>

I want to change my mind<br/>

'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br/>

I wanna raise your spirits<br/>

I want to see you smile but<br/>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>



Know that means I'll have to leave<br/>

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br/>

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br/>

<u>[Outro]</u><br/>
So I'll go, I'll go<br/>

I will go, go, go<br/>
