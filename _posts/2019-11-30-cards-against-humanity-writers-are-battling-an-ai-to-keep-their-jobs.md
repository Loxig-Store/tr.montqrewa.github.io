The creators of Cards Against Humanity are back for their annual Black Friday stunt. The human writers on the CAH team are facing off against an artificial intelligence to see who can create the most popular new pack of cards, based on how many people pay for more $5 packs. You can upvote or downvote your favorite cards for each side on CAH’s website before buying, and you can also watch the humans struggle to come up with new iterations in real time over live stream.

On the line are $5,000 bonuses for every employee if team human comes up victorious, or the AI takes the top spot. It is a clever stunt nonetheless to drum up the human vs. machine narrative at a time when automation may pose a very real threat to millions of jobs in the coming decade.

This year, CAH broadcasts human writers room live and updates the live list of the most popular AI-produced cards, which will transform them into physical card packages that will be sent next month. (You can buy both of them if you want.)

Cards Against Humanity Built A Real Neural Network Using A Model Created By OpenAI

The AI isn’t just some random text generator. It’s a legitimate neural network, borrowed from the open source GPT-2 model created by the AI research company OpenAI and specifically trained to write CAH cards. The GPT-2 model is trained on approximately 40,000 libraries of web text to ensure that it can reliably predict and fill the next word or punctuation in a realistic way. But then CAH went even further and trained tens of thousands of cards using their own cards.

“This was done by taking that pre-trained network and then training it further on the text of 44,000 white cards. That includes all (roughly) 2,000 cards in the official game, another 25,000 internal brainstorming cards that never made it into the game, and 17,000 unofficial cards from fan-curated lists,” reads the in-depth explanation of the AI on CAH’s website.

“We stopped the training once it could “consistently” produce cards matching the grammar and tone of the game,” “We did this so it didn’t draw too much from already-written cards while still leveraging as much cultural information as possible.” After that, CAH ran a straightforward filtering algorithm to ensure it could pluck out AI-generated cards that matched its standard format and to avoid ones that were too similar to existing cards.
