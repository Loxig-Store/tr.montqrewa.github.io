Squirrels are listening
-
It might sound crazy. But the squirrels are listening.

Researchers have known for years that squirrels overheard other types of alarm calls to signal dangerous situations in which they may not notice themselves. Now, a science team has uncovered another aspect of the curious nature of these rodents: squirrels can keep an eye on the birds' everyday conversation to see when a threat will pass.

The work, published today in PLOS ONE, implies that even for wildlife, the security language operates on a floating scale. Rather than relying on the absence of an alarm, squirrels listen to the presence of another signal to verify that the shores are clean - even if that means listening to the dialect of another species.

Squirrels are an open target in the forest

Most people may not (ever) care for him, but the flesh of squirrels did not lose its charm with the rest of the animal kingdom. These rodents are the focus of a large number of predators to fear - which means they need all the help they can get.

So perhaps it is not surprising that birds learn their language. Although these alarm calls are probably directed to birds' feather relatives, sharp-eared squirrels receive these calls.

A lot of information on alarm calls
-
But a few years ago, Oberlin College behavioral ecologist Keith Tarvin began to wonder whether alarm calls were only half the equation that squirrel eavesdropped. “There’s a lot of information in alarm calls,” he says. “It dawned on us that cues of safety might be equally informative.”

When a squirrel has a reason to believe that there is a crisis, it lowers whatever it is doing, and performs a series of awake behaviors, such as watching all its energy, freezing on the ground or running away.

Of course, the timing of these events is probably much more variable under natural conditions. After all, squirrels aren't always around birds that feel danger. However, this is “free, public information”.

“Squirrels are incredibly successful,” - Amanda Robin, a researcher at the University of California, who was not involved in the study. “This could be one more example of how they’re able to take advantage of things that are in their environment.”

How they learned is not yet clear
-
It is still unclear how squirrels have learned to adapt to the bird hunting conversation. However, the calls that were stolen in the survey included a dozen different birds, indicating the possibility of these rodents having cognitive flexibility in decoding similar signals from a wide variety of species (perhaps humans, including some of their loudest neighbors).

“This highlights how interconnected ecosystems are,” Robin says. “If you removed one species [like a bird], you might be changing the entire life of another species and not know.”
